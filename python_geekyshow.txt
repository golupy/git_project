what is python ?

python is object oriented programming language python has many features like:

it has huge library,easy to learn,high level language means it is easy for humans to understand,interpreted language and we can create any application with the help of python framework.

*What is python Compiler - Python Compiler converts source code into bytes code 
In python we have .pyc file for compilation of code.

Types of compiler :

1)Cpython
2)Pypy
3)AnacondaPython

*What is extension of python - .py

*What is Python Virtual Machine (PVM)or Interpreter - Interpreter convert Byte code into binary code and then machine work on this code and after that we get our result.

*What is identifiers or variable - Identifiers or Variabe can be any name store some value in it.

*What is reserve word - None,True,break,elif,if,False,exit,in,and,for,lambda,class,else,except,from,def,continue,raise,with,yield etc are reserved words which we cant use as an variable.

Is constant available in python - Python does not support concept of Constant.

*How can we declare a variable in python?

Variable name start with albhabate,cant use space to create a variable ,can use _(underscore)at the start of variable e.g _Name ,we can use _ between the variable name e.g. Full_Name 


*How many datatypes - Two types of datatypes present in python :
1)Built-in datatypes  :  None,Numeric,Sequence,Sets,Mapping
**)None  
**)Numeric : all the interger,float,Complex value stored in this datatypes

**)Sequennce : All the String,List,range etc are fall under the Sequence datatypes
#String : Group of charachter which is coverd by '' or "" are string. e.g. name="eti" 
#List : List is a set of same or different types of elements or values.We can change or modify list elements and list is reperesented by [] e.g. x=[1,2,"age",34.4]
#Tuples : Tuple is similar to list but tuple is only read only type it means we cant change or modify values or elements of tuples ,,Tuples represented by () e.g. 
y=(11,3.7,"address")
#Range : range represents sequnce of numbers.Numbers in the range can not be modify e.g ::
*)rg=range(5)  ## here range() is a builtin function
print(rg)
0 1 2 3 4 


*)f=range(1,12,2) ## here range(starting_point,ending_point,jump_of) 
print(f)
1 3 5 7 9 11 

**)Set : Set is collection of unique elements and the order of elements is not fixed that's why it is unordered collection of unique elements and we can't fetch elements of sets by indexing.Set is reperesented by {}

e.g. data={10,20,"pune",,"indore",98.4,20,40,"indore"}  #here 20 and indore are repeated
print(data)
{98.4, 'indore', 40, 10, 20, 'pune'}   #in this Set{} order of elements are changed and it contains only unique elements not contains duplicate elements

**)print(data[2])   #here we are trying to fetch elements by indexing 
TypeError: 'set' object is not subscriptable   #it through error because set is unorderd therefore we cant fetch elements by indexing

2)User defined datatypes  : Array,Class,Module are fall under User defined Datatypes


*How to check Datatypes of any variale - by using type() function we can check datatype of variable e.g. 
y=20
type(y)
<class 'int'> 

How many types of operators are there in python ?
arithmetic,logical,assigenment,binary,relational,membership operator,identical operator.

*)Membership Operator : In,Not In are used to check specific value present in specific variable or not
eg.S="world of unity";
if "uni" in S:
  print("string contain "uni")

*)Identical Operator : is,is not is used to compare two or more variables
e.g. a=10
b=20
if a is b :
	print("a and b are same")


What is print() ?   print is a function to display output. e.g 
e.g 
print("eti","tarun")
eti tarun
>>> print("eti","tarun",sep="***")
eti***tarun

What is input() ? input is a function to take input from user .input function() convert values into string
.e.g 
s=input("write your name")
write your name eti khandelwal
>>> print(s)
 eti khandelwal

>>> mob= input("enter your mobile number")
enter your mobile number 890064002012
>>> print(mob)
 890064002012
>>> print(type(mob))
<class 'str'>

--------------------------------------------
Topic - if ,if-else, if-elif-else statement

1)Check whether given input is even or not ?
num=input("enter a number")
if num%2==0:
	print("num is even")
else:
	print("num is odd")

2)unit=int(input("enter unit"))
if unit<=100:
    bill=0
    print("no bill")
elif unit>100 and unit <=200:
    bill_amt=(unit-100)*5
    print(bill_amt)
elif unit >200 and unit<=300:
    bill_amt=(unit-200)*10
    print(bill_amt)
else:
    print("bill will come soon")


2)a=int(input("enter age of a"))
b=int(input("enter age of b"))
c=int(input("enter age of c"))
d=int(input("enter age of d"))
if a<b and a<c and a<d:
    print("a is the youngest person")
elif b<a and b<c and b<d:
    print("b is the youngest person")
elif c<a and c<b and c<d:
    print("c is the youngest person")
elif d<a and d<b and d<c:
    print("d is the youngest person")
else:
    print("all of are have same age")
